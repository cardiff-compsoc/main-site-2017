        <p>
          We are a society dedicated to encouraging x, y, and z for Cardiff University COMSC students, and anyone interested in the Cardiff technology and Computer Science community.
        </p>
        <p>
          CompSoc hosts a number of regular events including socials, hackathons, industry talks, and more. For a full list of our current activities, please visit our <a href="./events.php">events</a> page.

        <h2 class="ui dividing header">Projects</h2>
        <p>
          Part of our core ethos is to encourage the natural drive of making cool stuff and exploring new ideas using all sorts of technology with as little barriers as possible. This is why we work hard with the School of Computer Science to ensure that as much support is given to students to make their idea of the next big thing a reality.

        <p>
          We are pleased to announce that all new CompSoc members will recieve an exclusive Cardiff University CompSoc <a href="http://esp32.net/">ESP32</a> development kit, along with a number of free workshop sessions that will get you up and exploring the possibilities of this kit as fast as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          If IoT isn't strictly your thing, or you're worried about your level of experience, don't worry! We will be offering workshops on a range of subjects from compiling your first program to building web applications, to teaching a computer to learn with machine learning.
        </p>

        <p>
          Also new for 2017 is the introduction of our Projects section, where we are working closely with the School of Computer Science, and our members to provide a whole host of open source projects that CompSoc members can get involved with!
